Hello users!

Here, is my First Project in Embedded C language.

In this project, I had used:-
    * KEIL software for generating hexcode of a C language code.
    * Proteus software for Circuit diagram and watching the working of my code.

You can easily use my code, just clone my repository and follow the following steps :-
    * Firstly clone my repository.
    * Now, you will see a Proteus file just open that and the circuit will be copied to your device.
    * Now, atlast open KEIL software and open my file you will see a c file code either open that file and convert it into hex file or just give hex code directly to the microprocessor which i had also provided.

Thanks user for user my code and cloning my repository!

Don't forget to star my repository and give some suggesstions or improvements which i can do to make it better.

The Software Version I had user were :-
    * Proteus :- [plc4me.com]Proteus_Pro_8.8.SP1
    * KEIL :- c51v960a
